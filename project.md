# Core project

The goal of our core project is to send temperature information from a sensor to a
remote server in the cloud. While this could seem very simple, the key element
of this project will be for student to explain all the steps involved.

## Building the temperature sensing device

First step is to get the data we want. So we will make a sensor using a Raspberry pi.

## Program the redirection of data

We will use the [Python](//python.org) programming language and use
[IPython](//ipython.org) as a platform to produce both presentation of the
code and results. If it's your first time using a programming language don't
worry I will assist you on the whole process. Python is easy to learn and you
will be able to get started in no time.

## Put the data in the cloud

There are several ways to put data up on the Internet. We will use
[plot.ly](https://plot.ly/) The main objective here is to have the data from
the sensor to their servers.

# Options

Once the project is done you can go check out the following extension :

## [Internet of Things & embedded systems](iot.html)

In this series of options we will explore the different kind of sensing that
can happen. How we can act on sensed information and see how engineers and
computer scientists use testbed to test vast sensing application.

## [Network](network.html)

In this series of options we will explore what is happening once a packet is
transmitted on the  network. No matter if it's through a wire or over the air,
networking is a vast subject and we will present some basics results of
transmission of information over the Internet.

## [Web](web.html)

This section is for understanding how the web works. What are the paradigms,
how browser and web pages works together. Go there if you want to know all the
magic that happen every time you spend time surfing. This is the place where
students can get  as creative as they want as the web is very versatile.
