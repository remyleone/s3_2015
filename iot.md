# Internet of Things

## Objectives of this part

- Understanding what means this buzz word
- Understanding why different protocols are needed

## Option Testbed

Testbed are commonly used by scientists and engineers both academic and industrial
to prototype applications, protocols and systems.
In this option, we will deploy code on several remote nodes.

*Requirements*

- [] Core [project](project.html) needs to be up and running

*Questions*

- How can we use nodes that are in a testbed to run experiment?
- Can we connect with nodes inside IoTlab?

<hr>

## Option Sensing

*Requirements*

- [] Core [project](project.html) needs to be up and running

*Questions*

- Find other sensors such as a camera, video, audio. What are new problems appearing?
- How can you send a stream of data to several remote places?

## Option Remote control

One of the cool aspect of sensing is the ability to trigger behavior when certain events occurs

*Requirements*

- [] Core [project](project.html) needs to be up and running

*Questions*

- How could you send it to several activators in the same time?
- How can you activate a remote system with sensors?
